# Randomeal: pick a restaurant at random

Sick of having to choose from the endless options available in 10bis? Can't think of anything you feel like eating?

Randomeal here for the rescue!

All you need to do is:
- Install the extension on your chrome: [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/randomeal/apninbblkbgpnahempblgggeijmfcnom?hl=en)
- Give it the access to the 10bis tab 
- Click the `GET RANDOM RESTAURANT` button

There you got it - a random restaurant.

Not satisfied with the option received? Go back and try again :)
